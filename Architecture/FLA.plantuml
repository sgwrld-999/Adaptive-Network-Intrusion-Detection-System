title First Layer Architecture - Adaptive Network IDS

start

:Load Normalized & Scaled Dataset;
:Extract Relevant Features;
:Split Data into Training & Validation Sets;

note right
Feature Engineering:
- Remove redundant features
- Apply Min-Max Scaling
end note

if (Is Data Shape Valid?) then (Yes)
    :Pass Data to Autoencoder-LSTM;
else (No)
    :Raise Exception & Reformat Data;
    stop
endif

    :LSTM Encoder - Compress Input Features;
    :LSTM Decoder - Reconstruct Normal Traffic Patterns;
    :Compute Reconstruction Error;
}

if (Reconstruction Error > Threshold?) then (Yes)
    :Mark as Anomaly;
    :Pass to CNN Feature Extractor;
else (No)
    :Mark as Benign;
    stop

    :Apply 1D Convolution to Enhance Features;
    :Extract Spatial Dependencies in Traffic Data;
    :Pass Features for Further Analysis;

:Store Processed Data & Anomaly Labels;
:Forward Anomalies to Layer 2 for Classification;
